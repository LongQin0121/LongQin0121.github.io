# CITS5505 WEB Project 1 Overview

## Project Description

In `Project 1 CITS5505`, I developed a dynamic website consisting of three main pages: **Concept**, **History**, and **CV**. 
## Technology Stack
The website was built using the following technologies:
- **HTML**: Structured the basic layout and content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styled the website to improve visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Added interactivity to the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for responsive design to ensure the site looks good on all devices.
- **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX calls.
- **AJAX**: Enabled asynchronous data requests without refreshing the web page, enhancing user experience.
